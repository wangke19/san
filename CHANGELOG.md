# Changelog

All notable changes to Gen Code are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [v1.16.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Open Identity: configurable assistant personas as markdown files at user or project scope; switch with `/identity`. Built-in `identity create` / `identity edit` workflows and auto-generated user-level template.
- Structured system prompt catalog: layered Slot/Section model with hot-patching (`Use` / `Drop` / `Refresh`).
- Reusable panel rendering for input-view selectors.

### Changed
- System prompt assembly refactored around `Section` and `Scope` types; subagent identity is replaced rather than overlaid.
- Documentation reorganized; new `docs/system-prompt.md` consolidates prompt design.

### Removed
- Agent fork mode (`Agent(fork: true)`) — subagents always start with fresh context.
- Legacy prompt template files (`base.txt`, `tools-*.txt`); replaced by `prompts/identity.txt`, `prompts/policy.txt`, `prompts/guidelines/*.txt`.

## [v1.15.14] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Permission system with mode-based access control for agents and tools.

### Changed

- Improved bash AST parsing and settings merger.

## [v1.15.11] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Permission modes for agent execution: `explore`, `edit`, `default`.

## [v1.15.9] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Queue methods `DequeuePending` and `RemoveSentToInbox` for precise sent-item lifecycle.
- `HandleAgentMessage` for processing agent-injected user messages.

### Fixed
- Queue input injection: properly remove injected queued items and hold turn boundary until agent confirms.

## [v1.15.8] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Queue selection: `Up` / `Down` navigate between queue items and history entries.
- OpenAI model token limits fetched from official docs with caching.

### Changed
- Tool execution: parallel only for read-only batches; sequential when side effects are possible.
- Edit tool: clearer error messages when `old_string` is missing or non-unique.
- System prompts: clarify that dependent tool calls must not be batched.
- Queue selected-item styling.

### Fixed
